# Co-op Bank Curency Converter

## By Ed Payton

Built with Next.js & Typescript
Tested with React Testing Library
Uses the [Co-op Experience Library](https://static.coop.co.uk/experience-library/ 'Co-op Experience Library') for styling

### Install and run

```bash
# install
npm i

# run
npm run dev

#test
npm t
```

The project is set up as I would a real production app.
For the scale of the app it could be seen as overengineered, but my aim was to demonstrate best practice coding.
Some areas that still need work, for example there is only one test which is not complete, and I need to add flag images into the country list.
I hope this fulfills your requirements, and I look forward to the opportunity to discussing the project with you.

Thanks
Ed
